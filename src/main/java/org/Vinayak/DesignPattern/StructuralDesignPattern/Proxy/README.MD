The Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you want to add an additional layer of control over an object without modifying the object's code.

In the Proxy Design Pattern:

Proxy Object: Acts as an intermediary between the client and the real object. It holds a reference to the real object and controls access to it.

Real Object: The actual object that the proxy represents. The real object performs the primary operations, but its access is managed by the proxy.

Lazy Initialization: The proxy can instantiate the real object only when it's needed.
Access Control: The proxy can control access to the real object, such as authentication checks.
Logging and Monitoring: The proxy can log requests and usage statistics.
Remote Proxy: The proxy can represent an object in a different address space, typically used in distributed systems.
