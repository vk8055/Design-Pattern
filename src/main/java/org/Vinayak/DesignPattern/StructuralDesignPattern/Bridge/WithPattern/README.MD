Bridge Design Pattern

* Divides and organizes a single class that has multiple
  variants of same functionality into two hierarchies : abstractions and implementations
* Applies single responsibility and the open-closed principles.
* Independently introduce new abstractions and implementations, making it very easy to switch
between them at runtime.
* Client code wont be exposed to implementation details.
